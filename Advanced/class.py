'''
python known a clean language, when we want to do something in Python 
we just do.
'''


class MyClassName:
    pass


'''
when we right oop using python code in python , we define the class using the reserved 
word class (CamelCase).Using pass just indicate that there is more code just 
leave as is right now
'''

# here we are using a, b to store instances of the class in var a and b
# now a, b are stored in the memory uniquely
a = MyClassName()
b = MyClassName()

'''
 here when we care calling the a, b , actually we don't use the class itself but we are using instances of 
 it using the __init__ function inside it,__init__ is the constructor of the class in python 
 if we don't initialized one the class will inherit th init form the base Object  


 so init is the constructor of the class that initialized the object when it is created
to write it in this way __init__ to make the interperter of python ro treat it as a special 
function
