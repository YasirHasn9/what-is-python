in oop computer programs makes use of objects to talk to each other to change the data 
inside these object

There is 2 ways of writing code
        1. procedural programming 
        2. opp
    
the problem with procedural programming is tunning the code into spaghetti when the 
code gets more complex and big 
because the code made of variables and subroutines and data structure 

in oop (Object-orinted programming) 4 Pillars
1.Encapsulation
The main purpose of using oop is to define the object's public interface
so other attribute and methods in other object can intercate with this object so that
other object need to get access to the inner of the main object
so it means to hide the implementation details of an object


2.Abstraction
in its simplest concept, pay more attention to the details and modify your 
object for each task
One tip to achieve the right level of abstraction is to only model exactly 
what the system needs to perform. 


3. inheritance is like a family tree
object can inherit attributes and methods from different objects


4.polymorphism
is the ability  to treat a class differently depending of the need of subclasses
like chesse , we have a player and Rook, Bishop, King, Knight, Queen, and Pawn
for each has a different move
