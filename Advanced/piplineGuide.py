# to use python built -in class , we have to import it
'''
import somthingThatBuiltAlreadyInPython
'''
import math


'''
but sometimes we write our own class and we want to use it in other places

from locationOfOurModule import nameOfOurModule
'''

from 'store/store.py' import Store

'''
and also we want to use more than one class from the same module in different place

from location import class_1 , class_2

python loves visual indentation
