# Boolean
'''
All the languages have truthy and falsy statement, which is so imporatnt to understand them
because sometimes they are a live savior ;) and can save you a lot of time.
Python is one of these langauges who support this truthy and falsy things
'''
print(True)  # so easy , right ?
print(False)
'''
Make sure you write them they way i did ^ with quotation marks and the first letter should be 
an uppercased 
I know you are smart and would ask, what is the point of them ?
sometimes as a programmer you wanna make sure that there is something true to do 
some operation otherwise do someting else. Think of how your facebook knows your information , there 
must be someting true about you otherwise it wouldnt allow you to get in ,right ?
so booleans are so important in perform some actions

sometimes we explicitly useing the word True/False or we can genrate through using some operations
like
'''
print(10 == 10)  # true
# notice in campersion things , we use double equal sign (==)
print(10 == 9)  # false
print({} == {})  # true
print([] == [])  # true
# print({name: "Yasir"} == {name: "Yasir"})  # invalid , why ? google it
#  learn how to google things up , its part of your job
'''
if you wanna a little be fancy and have a readable code you can use the plain english 
like
'''
print(10 is 10)
print(10 is not 9) # you can do this with strings as well
# isn't it lovely ?
# we will go into it more in the future
