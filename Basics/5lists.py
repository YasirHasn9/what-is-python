# List
'''
Lists are the bread and butter of how to structure your data and include them in place
you can make a list by using [ these brackets  ] and each item in the list 
has its own index number 
lists in python are zero-based-index which means if you wanna 
access an item inside the list you have to count from zero, 
 okay, what does it mean ?
   --  lets say you have a list of numbers 
   numbers = [10,20,30,40,50]
   and you wanna get access to the first number in the list
   numbers[0] == 10
   numbers[1] == 20 and so on so forth 
'''

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(numbers[0])  # --> 10
print(numbers[1])  # --> 20

'''
there are different ways of accessing an item from a list 
and we are gonna visit them in the future
