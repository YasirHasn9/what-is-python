# Variables
'''
programmers hate to reinvent the wheel even when it comes 
to small string and numbers so Variables come to the world so we dont need 
to repeat ourselves again and again.
what is a variable ?
     variable is just a placeholder that can holds different types of values(number,string,list,dict,
     functions,booleans)
      and that holder can be reuse in multiable places
'''

name = "Joe"
num = 2
myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
myDict = {
    "name": name,
    "number": num,
    "li": myList,
}
print(myDict)
"""
Notice how did i reuse the variables in different place
google the manners of how to name variables ?
