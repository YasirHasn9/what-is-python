# Built-in function

each language has its own built-in function depends on the amount of using them
i have used the built-in function print() so many time
so the people who work on python notice that they need of this kind of function 
so the created it 

in your joinery as programmer, you will need this kind of function even 
you will use other code that been written by other programmers to make 
so action and solve some problems for you

print(str(6))  # str : convert to string
print(int(8.8))  # int :convert to integer number
'''
