# Function
'''
Almost every programming langauge has this feature and also each one of them 
has its own way for writing function and python one of them
what is function ?
  -- it is a block of codes that could be 2 lines of code or 100 of lines,
  that could do one purpose of many purposes depends on what do want out of this 
  function 
  persenely, i like singled-purpose function and also this is best practice

  how do you write a function in python ?
  1- def -- > declear a function by starting with the word def
      def --> indicates that this is a function
  
  2- function's name so you can use where ever you want


  3- () use brathensis () these can hold parameters 
     we are gonna dig into them in the future but they are so easy :)

  4- : colon to indicate the end of the declareation of the function 
'''

# declear the function named "get_x"


def get_x():
    # do something here
    x = 100
    print(x)


# how to use this function in your programming ?
#  easy just call/invoke the function , but how do you call it ?
# like this
get_x()  # and thats it
'''
notice how i wrote the function 
there is 2 ways for writing function , camel case and snake case
camel case --> myFunction
                   or
               myFunctionForDoingSomething
    -- the second starts within uppercase letter 

snake case my_function
                   or
           my_function_for_doing_something
    -- there _ that separates the words 


also the indentation is so important in writing functions when it comes to 
python 
whatever you wanna write within your function should be 4 spaces or at least 
1 tap inside it
